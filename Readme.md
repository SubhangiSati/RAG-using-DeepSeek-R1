# RAG Using DeepSeek

This repository documents my exploration and learning journey with **RAG using DeepSeek** on [Lightning AI](https://lightning.ai). The project leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for building systems that efficiently handle retrieval-based tasks with a focus on enhancing generative models using external knowledge.

## Overview

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a framework that combines retrieval and generation capabilities. It enables large language models (LLMs) to:

1. Access external knowledge sources like databases or document stores.
2. Retrieve the most relevant information.
3. Combine this information with generative AI models for highly contextualized and accurate responses.

The **DeepSeek** implementation simplifies this process by offering a streamlined studio for experimenting with RAG pipelines, including retrieval, model fine-tuning, and inference.

## Features of RAG Using DeepSeek

1. **Document Ingestion and Indexing**:
   - Upload custom datasets (e.g., PDFs, text files, etc.).
   - Index documents for fast retrieval using vector search techniques powered by FAISS or Pinecone.

2. **Retriever Module**:
   - Extracts the most relevant data from the indexed documents.
   - Supports similarity search using embeddings generated by pretrained models like Sentence Transformers.

3. **Generative Model Integration**:
   - Combines retrieved data with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT models or HuggingFace Transformers) to provide detailed and accurate responses.
   - Fine-tune the model for specific use cases.

4. **Evaluation and Monitoring**:
   - Provides tools to assess the retrieval quality and generative performance.
   - Metrics include retrieval accuracy, generation relevance, and response latency.

## My Learning and Implementation Steps

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- I explored document ingestion by uploading a dataset of my choice.
- Experimented with creating embeddings for the dataset using Sentence Transformers.

### 2. Indexing Documents
- Indexed the uploaded documents into a vector database.
- Analyzed the indexing process and its efficiency for large datasets.

### 3. Retrieval Mechanism
- Used the retriever module to query indexed documents based on user prompts.
- Validated the quality of retrieved documents by comparing them with the ground truth.

### 4. Generative Model Integration
- Integrated a pretrained GPT model for generating responses based on the retrieved content.
- Explored how the model incorporates contextual information from the retriever for accurate answers.

### 5. Model Fine-tuning
- Fine-tuned the LLM for better alignment with the dataset and specific use cases.
- Understood the trade-offs between generalization and specificity in RAG systems.

### 6. Performance Evaluation
- Assessed the RAG pipeline's performance using retrieval accuracy and response relevance.
- Experimented with varying the embedding model and retriever configurations to optimize results.
